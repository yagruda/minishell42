# execve
execve is the system call that actually runs a new program in place of the current one. In a minishell, it's the key to executing external commands like ls, cat, or echo.

## ðŸ§  Why You Need execve in a Minishell
When your shell parses a command like ls -l, it needs to:

Create a new process to run ls without killing the shell itself.

Replace the child processâ€™s memory with the ls program.

Let the parent shell wait for the child to finish.

This is done using:

fork() â†’ creates a new process (child).

execve() â†’ replaces the childâ€™s memory with the new program.

waitpid() â†’ lets the parent wait for the child to finish.

Without execve, your shell wouldnâ€™t actually run external programsâ€”it would just sit there pretending.
## ðŸ“Œ Key Points About execve
Prototype: int execve(const char *pathname, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);

pathname: Full path to the executable (e.g., /bin/ls)

argv: Argument list (first is usually the program name)

envp: Environment variables (can pass environ or NULL)

## ðŸ§ª Common Pitfalls
If execve fails, it returns -1 and sets errno. Always check with perror().

It does not return on success. The current process is replaced.

You must fork() firstâ€”never call execve in the main shell process unless you want to kill your shell.
